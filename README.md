An SNES style JRPG. Mostly to teach myself OOP and proper python habbits.

System requirments:
    
    Python 2.7 with libraries:
        pygame
        pyscroll
        pytmx
        (These can be installed with pip.)

    1280x720 (or larger) display
    Keyboard
    Sound output

Uses creative commons art and sound assets. Artists and specific asset details are listed in the credits screen.

Tested on Windows and Linux. But any platform that has Python 2.7 and the needed libraries should work.

License yet to be determined.
